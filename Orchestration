Container orchestration is all about managing the life cycle of containers, especally in large and dynamic environment.
* provisoning and deployment of containers
* Scaling up or removieng containers
* movement of containers from one host to another
* Load balacing and service discovery between containers
* Health monitoring of containers and hosts
Minimum of 2 web-server should be running all the time
Example. Amazone ECS task placement. its an orchestration tool
Container orchestration Solutions
 * Docker Swarm, kubernetes, Apaches Mesos, AWS ECS
Managed kubernetes like EKS -: since it would be difficult 

-- docker service ls

docker swarm is a container orchestration tool which is natively supported by docker
swarm cluster -: are the collection of the nodes
Node is an instance of the docker engine participating in the swarm
the manager node dispatches units of work called task to the worker node

--- docker swarm init --advertise-addr 'manager ip'
--- ifconfig
---- ifconfig eth0
---- docker swam join --token 'copy and paste the token generated when creating the manager node'
---- docker node ls
when deleting a  node first it have to be demouted

Service -: the defination of the task to execute on the manager or worker nodes

-- docker service create --name webserver --replicas 2 nginx
-- docker service ps webserver
